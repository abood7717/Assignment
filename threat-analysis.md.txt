# Threat Analysis Summary

This document outlines key threats and mitigations for each component and data flow in the IoT-based Healthcare Monitoring System using the STRIDE model.

---

## 1. IoT Device

**Threat (Tampering):**  
An attacker may modify health data before it's transmitted to the cloud.  
**Mitigation:**  
Use TLS 1.3 and digital signatures to ensure data integrity.

**Threat (Denial of Service):**  
Attackers may flood the device with requests to prevent data upload.  
**Mitigation:**  
Implement rate limiting and a watchdog timer.

---

## 2. Patient

**Threat (Information Disclosure):**  
Sensitive vitals may be intercepted during transmission.  
**Mitigation:**  
Ensure encrypted communication using TLS 1.3.

---

## 3. Doctor

**Threat (Spoofing):**  
An attacker may impersonate a doctor to access private data.  
**Mitigation:**  
Use Multi-Factor Authentication and session validation.

---

## 4. Cloud Database

**Threat (Information Disclosure):**  
Unauthorized access to stored patient data.  
**Mitigation:**  
Encrypt data at rest using AES-256 and enforce access control.

**Threat (Repudiation):**  
Malicious users may deny modifying or accessing data.  
**Mitigation:**  
Implement full audit logging and non-repudiation tokens.

## 5. Doctor Dashboard

**Threat (Elevation of Privilege):**  
A regular user may gain admin access.  
**Mitigation:**  
Use strict RBAC and validate all user roles.

---

## 6. Data Flow: IoT Device → Cloud DB

**Threat (Tampering in Transit):**  
Data may be modified during transfer.  
**Mitigation:**  
Encrypt communication with TLS and verify message integrity.

---

## 7. Data Flow: Doctor → Dashboard

**Threat (Spoofing):**  
Attacker could use stolen credentials.  
**Mitigation:**  
Enforce OAuth 2.0, MFA, and session timeout.

---

**Conclusion:**  
Although the MTMT tool didn’t auto-generate threats, all core STRIDE threats were identified manually and appropriate mitigations were proposed. The threat model diagram reflects key system components and data flows and is included as `threat-model.pdf`.
