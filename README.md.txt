# IoT-based Healthcare Monitoring System

This system is designed to monitor patients' vital signs (e.g., heart rate, oxygen levels, temperature) using IoT wearable sensors. The data is transmitted to a cloud server where doctors and caregivers can monitor health status in real-time.

## Why Dependability and Security are Important

The system handles sensitive medical data, which must remain confidential, accurate, and consistently available to support urgent health decisions. High reliability is crucial for patient safety, and strong security is required to prevent unauthorized access or data tampering.
