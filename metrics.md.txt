# Reliability Metrics

## 1. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
This metric helps measure the average time between system breakdowns. For an IoT healthcare system, maximizing MTBF ensures consistent monitoring and reduces service interruptions that could impact patient care.

## 2. System Availability
This metric calculates the percentage of time the system is operational. With a target of 99.9%, high availability ensures that patient data is accessible to caregivers when needed, which is critical in emergencies.
